        <title>AVOCADO QUINOA SALAD – MENDOCINO FARMS COPYCAT</title>
    </head>
          <p>
            This Avocado Quinoa Salad is a spot-on copycat of my all-time favorite from 
            Mendocino Farms, where I actually used to work. It's loaded with crispy quinoa, 
            fresh veggies, and a zesty chipotle vinaigrette that's just irresistible. 
            I loved it so much, I had to recreate it at home – and now you can too!

    <ul>DRESSING

        In a blender or food processor, combine honey, distilled white vinegar, 
        Dijon mustard, a pinch of salt, paprika, adobo chipotle paste, chili powder, 
        neutral oil, and water.
        Blend until the dressing is well emulsified.
        Set the dressing aside.
    </ul>
<ul>CRISPY QUINOA CRUNCHIES

    Preheat your oven to 400°F (205°C).
    Spread cooked quinoa on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
    Drizzle avocado oil over the quinoa and toss to coat evenly.
    Bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes, stirring halfway through, until the quinoa becomes golden and crispy. Keep an eye on it to prevent burning.
    Once crispy, remove from the oven and let it cool.

    In a large salad bowl, combine chopped romaine lettuce, chopped kale, diced avocados, 
    diced tomatoes, drained and rinsed black beans, thinly sliced red onion, roasted corn, 
    and chopped fresh cilantro. Toss everything together until well mixed.
    Once the quinoa has cooled, sprinkle it over the salad for a delightful crunch.
    Drizzle the chipotle vinaigrette over the salad and toss to coat everything evenly.
    Finish the salad by sprinkling crumbled cotija cheese on top.
    Serve immediately and enjoy!
