            <b>Crown shyness</b> (also canopy disengagement,<sup>[1]</sup> canopy shyness,<sup>[2]
            </sup>or inter-crown spacing<sup>[3]</sup>) is a phenomenon observed in some tree species,
              in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do not touch each other, 
              forming a canopy with channel-like gaps.<sup>[4][5] </sup>The phenomenon is most 
              prevalent among trees of the same species, but also occurs between trees of
               different species.[<sup>6][7]</sup> There exist many hypotheses as to why crown shyness
                is an adaptive behavior, and research suggests that it might inhibit spread 
                of leaf-eating insect larvae.<sup>[8]</sup>
