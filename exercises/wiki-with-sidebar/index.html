                This article is about the relaunched game, also known as A 
                Realm Reborn. For the defunct original release, see Final

                <b>Final Fantasy XIV</b>[c] is a massively multiplayer online 
                role-playing game (MMORPG) developed and published by Square 
                Enix. Directed and produced by Naoki Yoshida and released 
                worldwide for PlayStation 3 and Windows in August 2013, it 
                replaced the failed 2010 version, with subsequent support for 
                PlayStation 4, macOS, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S. Final 
                Fantasy XIV is set in the fantasy region of Eorzea, five years 
                after the devastating Seventh Umbral Calamity which ended the 
                original version. In the Calamity, the elder primal Bahamut 
                escaped from his prison, an ancient space station called Dalamud
                , unleashing an apocalypse across Eorzea. Through temporal magic
                , the player character of the original version escaped, 
                reappearing at the start of A Realm Reborn. As Eorzea cements 
                its recovery, the player must fend off a reignited invasion from 
                the Garlean Empire.

                The original Final Fantasy XIV was a commercial and critical 
                failure. Then-Square Enix President Yoichi Wada announced that a
                new team, led by Yoshida, would assume control and address the 
                game's flaws. The new team both continued to develop and improve
                the original version, and secretly worked on a completely new 
                replacement. This new game, codenamed "Version 2.0", used a new
                engine, improved server infrastructure, and revamped gameplay,
                nterface, and story. The original version shut down in 
                November 2012, followed by an alpha test for Version 2.0.

                The relaunched game released to largely positive reception; 
                critics praised its solid mechanics and progression, and 
                commended Yoshida for an unexpected recovery. After a poor 2013 
                fiscal year, Square Enix attributed the 2014 return to 
                profitability partly to the game's strong sales and subscriber 
                base. By October 2021, it had gained over 24 million registered 
                players and become the most profitable Final Fantasy game to 
                date.[1] Final Fantasy XIV has received regular updates since 
                release, including five major expansion packs: Heavensward 
                (2015), Stormblood (2017), Shadowbringers (2019), Endwalker 
                (2021), and Dawntrail (2024).

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <hr></hr>
            <p> 
                Final Fantasy XIV is an MMORPG, featuring a persistent world 
                where players can interact with each other and the environment. 
                Players create and customize their characters for use in the 
                game, including name, race, gender, facial features, and 
                starting class. Unlike in the original release, players may only 
                choose to be a Disciple of War or Magic as a starting 
                class—Disciples of the Hand and Land are initially unavailable.
                [2] Players must also select a game server for each character. 
                While all supported languages are available on every server, 
                data centers are located in specific regions (i.e., North 
                America, Europe, Japan, and Oceania) to reduce latency between 
                client and server, and players are advised to choose a server in
                their region.[3] Regardless of server or language, players can 
                use a large library of automatically translated game terms and 
                general phrases, allowing players who speak different languages 
                to communicate.[4]

            </p>
            <p>
                PC and home console versions use a unified user interface (UI) 
                and control scheme allowing for any combination of keyboard, 
                mouse, and game controller. On PC, the game defaults to drag and 
                drop menus, whereas on the console versions, the default 
                interface resembles the PlayStation 3's XrossMediaBar.[5] This 
                bar is used to access menus, maps, logs, and configuration 
                options. The head-up display for both versions includes a 
                message log, party status menu, mini-map, and action bar. The 
                size and location of all UI elements may be customized.[6]

            <p>
                Actions and battle commands differ between PC and console 
                versions. The PC versions support both point and click and 
                keyboard input for commands or macros. Macro commands are 
                customizable sequences of actions that allow players to execute 
                desired abilities at a specific time. The home console versions 
                instead map the action bar and macros to the "Cross Hotbar"—sets 
                of four icons arranged in a cross shape. These are the grouped 
                and accessed through a combination of the shoulder buttons and 
                the directional pad or the face buttons. Using each shoulder 
                button to cycle through the cross sets, players have quick 
                access to commands. This interface is also available to PC 
                players who use controllers.[5]

            <h4>Character progression</h4>
            <p>In addition to these player versus environment (PvE) challenges, 
                various forms of player versus player (PvP) combat exist in 
                Final Fantasy XIV. The Feast was an arena featuring structured 
                four-versus-four battles where a player could register with up 
                to three teammates to challenge another four-person team. This 
                mode was removed in patch 6.1, when it was replaced with 
                Crystalline Conflict,[11] which consists of two teams of five 
                competing to seize control of and push a crystal which starts at 
                the middle of the arena to each team's goal point. The second 
                type, Frontlines, is a large battleground in which players form 
                teams of up to 24 members. Teams are delineated by players' 
                allegiance to one of three Grand Companies and the team which 
                reaches the target number of points first wins the match. 
                Multiple modes are available, each with differing locations and 
                rulesets. Within the game, Frontlines is presented as an 
                organized set of military exercises between the three nations 
                with the ulterior goal of jockeying for dominance of regions 
                rich in magical artifacts.[12] The third type, Rival Wings, is a 
                battle arena mode where players manipulate minion waves and 
                pilot mechs to destroy enemy objectives.
