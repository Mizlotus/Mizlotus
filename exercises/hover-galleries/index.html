                        History of Nature
                        A note on Nature’s archive
                        Nature’s archive comprises all the content published 
                        since the journal’s launch in 1869;  it includes some 
                        images, articles and language that by 
                        twenty-first-century standards are offensive and 
                        harmful, including sexist, racist and other 
                        discriminatory content. This content does not represent 
                        Nature’s current values and would be unacceptable to 
                        publish today. We have not sought to suppress it because 
                        it is part of the scientific and historical record, and 
                        so should remain available for scholars now and in the 
                        future. Nature is committed to making the changes 
                        necessary to ensure that it learns from its past and 
                        creates a publication that champions science for 
                        everyone.

                        Most of the country drives during an eastern North 
                        American summer will turn up a few Eastern Bluebirds 
                        sitting on telephone wires or perched atop a nest box, 
                        calling out in a short, wavering voice or abruptly 
                        dropping to the ground after an insect. Marvelous birds 
                        to capture in your binoculars, male Eastern Bluebirds 
                        are a brilliant royal blue on the back and head, and 
                        warm red-brown on the breast. Blue tinges in the wings
                         and tail give the grayer females an elegant look.
