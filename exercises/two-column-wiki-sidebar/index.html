                Realm Reborn. For the defunct original release, see Final

                Final Fantasy XIV[c] is a massively multiplayer online 
                role-playing game (MMORPG) developed and published by Square 
                Enix. Directed and produced by Naoki Yoshida and released 
                worldwide for PlayStation 3 and Windows in August 2013, it 
                replaced the failed 2010 version, with subsequent support for 
                PlayStation 4, macOS, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S. Final 
                Fantasy XIV is set in the fantasy region of Eorzea, five years 
                after the devastating Seventh Umbral Calamity which ended the 
                original version. In the Calamity, the elder primal Bahamut 
                escaped from his prison, an ancient space station called Dalamud
                , unleashing an apocalypse across Eorzea. Through temporal magic
                , the player character of the original version escaped, 
                reappearing at the start of A Realm Reborn. As Eorzea cements 
                its recovery, the player must fend off a reignited invasion from 
                the Garlean Empire.

                The original Final Fantasy XIV was a commercial and critical 
                failure. Then-Square Enix President Yoichi Wada announced that a
                new team, led by Yoshida, would assume control and address the 
                game's flaws. The new team both continued to develop and improve
                the original version, and secretly worked on a completely new 
                replacement. This new game, codenamed "Version 2.0", used a new
                engine, improved server infrastructure, and revamped gameplay,
                nterface, and story. The original version shut down in 
                November 2012, followed by an alpha test for Version 2.0.

                The relaunched game released to largely positive reception; 
                critics praised its solid mechanics and progression, and 
                commended Yoshida for an unexpected recovery. After a poor 2013 
                fiscal year, Square Enix attributed the 2014 return to 
                profitability partly to the game's strong sales and subscriber 
                base. By October 2021, it had gained over 24 million registered 
                players and become the most profitable Final Fantasy game to 
                date.[1] Final Fantasy XIV has received regular updates since 
                release, including five major expansion packs: Heavensward 
                (2015), Stormblood (2017), Shadowbringers (2019), Endwalker 
                (2021), and Dawntrail (2024).
