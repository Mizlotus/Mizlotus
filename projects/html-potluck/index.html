            Gochujang creates a quick flavor-packed sauce for 
            juicy shrimp and just-tender asparagus. The result 
            is a 5-ingredient meal that pops with savory-sweet heat.

        <h3>Directions</h3>
           <ol>Step 1
            In small bowl, stir together gochujang and 3 to 4 tablespoons water; set aside.
            Step 2
            Heat 1/2 tablespoon oil in large skillet on medium-high. Add asparagus, scallions white and
            light green parts, and 1/4 teaspoon salt and cook, without stirring, 2 minutes. Toss and continue 
            cooking, tossing occasionally, until just tender, 2 to 3 minutes more; transfer to plate and wipe out 
            skillet.
            Step 3
            Heat remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil on medium. Add shrimp and cook, without stirring, 2 minutes. 
            Flip and cook 1 minute more. Return asparagus and scallions to skillet along with gochujang sauce
             and cook, tossing, until shrimp is opaque throughout and coated in sauce, 30 to 60 seconds.
            Step 4
            Remove from heat and toss with lemon juice. Sprinkle with dark scallion greens and serve with lemon 
            wedges if desired.

                For a super easy, nut-free take on pesto, we swapped in cottage cheese. It adds creaminess and
                body (and a good dose of protein!). Be sure to reserve some pasta cooking water for tossing the 
                saucy pasta with kale before serving.

                Skip the croutons and cut golden samosas into bite-size pieces for a delightfully fun and 
                flavorful salad topper. Mango chutney whisked into the dressing provides a tangy-sweet boost.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2> 
           <ul>
                14 oz. potato and pea samosas (12 to 16 small)
                2 medium yellow onions, sliced into 1/4-inch-thick wedges
                4 Tbsp. olive oil, divided
                Kosher salt
                1/2  jalapeño, finely chopped
                3 Tbsp. mango chutney
                2 Tbsp. white wine vinegar
                1 c. frozen peas, thawed
                1 5-ounce container baby spinach
                1/2 c. cilantro leaves, roughly chopped
                1/3 c. mint leaves, roughly chopped
           </ul>
            <br></br> <br></br> 
        <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <b>Step 1</b>
                Heat oven to 375°F. On rimmed baking sheet, bake samosas until golden brown and warmed through,
                20 to 25 minutes (depending on brand). Transfer to cutting board and cut each into 3 pieces.
                <b>Step 2</b>
                Meanwhile, on separate rimmed baking sheet, toss onions with 2 tablespoons oil and 1/4 teaspoon 
                each salt and pepper. Bake along with samosas 15 minutes. Toss onions with jalapeño and bake until 
                onion is browned in spots, about 5 minutes more.
                <b>Step 3</b>
                Meanwhile, in small bowl, whisk together mango chutney, vinegar, and remaining 2 tablespoons oil.
                <b>Step 4</b>
                Toss onions with peas and spinach and bake until peas are warm and spinach begins to wilt, 1 to 2 
                minutes. Toss with cilantro and mint and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Divide spinach salad among plates, top 
                with samosas and drizzle with dressing.
