            <b>Crown shyness</b> (also canopy disengagement,<sup>[1]</sup> canopy shyness,<sup>[2]</sup>
            or inter-crown spacing<sup>[3]</sup>) is a phenomenon observed in some tree species,
            in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do not touch each other, 
            forming a canopy with channel-like gaps.<sup>[4][5] </sup>The phenomenon is most 
            prevalent among trees of the same species, but also occurs between trees of
            different species.[<sup>6][7]</sup> There exist many hypotheses as to why crown shyness
            is an adaptive behavior, and research suggests that it might inhibit spread 
            of leaf-eating insect larvae.<sup>[8]</sup>

              <p>
                  The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is uncertain .<sup>[6]</sup>The phenomenon has been discussed 
                  in scientificliterature since the 1920s.<sup>[9]</sup> The variety of hypotheses and experimental results 
                  might suggest that there are multiple mechanisms across different species,
                  an example of<b> convergent evolution.</b>[citation needed]
         </p>  
             <p>
                Some hypotheses contend that the interdigitation of canopy branches leads to "reciprocal pruning" of adjacent trees: 
                trees in windy areas suffer physical damage as they collide with each other during winds; the abrasions and collisions 
                induce a crown shyness response. Studies suggest that lateral branch growth is largely uninfluenced by neighbours until
                disturbed by mechanical abrasion.<sup>[10]</sup> If the crowns are artificially prevented from colliding 
                in the winds, they gradually fill the canopy gaps.<sup>[11]</sup> This explains instances of crown shyness between branches of 
                the same organism. Proponents of this idea cite that shyness is particularly seen in conditions conducive to this 
                pruning, including windy forests, stands of flexible trees, and early succession forests where branches are flexible 
                and limited in lateral movement.<sup>[6][12]</sup> According to this theory, variable flexibility in lateral branches greatly 
                influences the degree of crown shyness.

                Similarly, some research suggests that constant abrasion at growth nodules disrupts bud tissue such that it is 
                unable to continue with lateral growth. Australian forester M.R. Jacobs, who studied the crown shyness patterns in
                eucalyptus in 1955, believed that the trees' growing tips were sensitive to abrasion, resulting in canopy gaps.[13] 
                Miguel Franco (1986) observed that the branches of Picea sitchensis (Sitka spruce) and Larix kaempferi (Japanese 
                larch) suffered physical damage due to abrasion, which killed the leading shoots.<sup>[14][15]</sup>
         </p>

              <p>
                 A prominent hypothesis is that canopy shyness has to do with mutual light sensing by adjacent plants.
                 The photoreceptor-mediated shade avoidance response is a well-documented behavior in a variety of plant 
                 species.<sup>[16]</sup> Neighbor detection is thought to be a function of several unique photoreceptors. Plants can 
                 sense the proximity of neighbors by sensing backscattered far-red light, a task widely thought to be 
                 accomplished by the activity of the <b>phytochrome</b> photoreceptors.<sup>[17]</sup> Many species of plant respond to an 
                 increase in <b>far-red</b> light (and, by extension, encroaching neighbors) by directing growth away from the 
                 far-red stimulus and by increasing the rate of elongation.<sup>[18]</sup> Similarly, plants use blue light to induce 
                 the shade-avoidance response, likely playing a role in the recognition of neighboring plants,<sup>[19]</sup> though 
                 this was just starting to be recognised in 1988.<sup>[20]</sup>
          </p>
              
         <p>
                 The characterization of these behaviors might suggest that crown shyness is simply the result of mutual shading based on
                 well-understood shade avoidance responses.<sup?[6][21]</sup> Malaysian scholar <b>Francis S.P. Ng,</b> who studied <b>Dryobalanops 
                 aromatica, aromatica,</b>suggested that the growing tips were sensitive to light levels and stopped growing when nearing 
                 the adjacent foliage due to the induced shade.<sup>[6][21]</sup>
        </p>

        <p>
            A 2015 study has suggested that <b>Arabidopsis thaliana</b> shows different leaf placement strategies when grown amongst
            kin and unrelated conspecifics, shading dissimilar neighbors and avoiding kin. This response was shown to be 
            contingent on the proper functioning of multiple photosensory modalities.<sup>[22]</sup> A 1998 study proposed similar systems 
            of photoreceptor-mediated inhibition of growth as explanations of crown shyness,<sup>[6][21]</sup> though a causal link between 
            photoreceptors and crown asymmetry had yet to be experimentally proven. This might explain instances of intercrown
            spacing that are only exhibited between conspecifics.<sup>[6][7]</sup>
